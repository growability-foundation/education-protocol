## What is Education Protocol?

Education Protocol this is protocol that storage for education certificates based on smart contracts that can be easy to integrate with any source of getting knowledge.

## How this works?

### Education Profile

Education Protocol provide unique NFT profile to user that will keep all information about knowledge that user got.

We use on-chain verification with WorldID to determine the uniqueness of the user. Therefore, one user can only create a profile once.

This is a single profile for any course, educational program or other source of knowledge. All received certificates will be linked to your profile.

### Education Organization (Knowledge Provider)

Any source of knowledge can be registered as an Education Organization on Education Protocol, for example:

- Blog
- Chat in messenger
- Site with courses
- Educational institution
- AI

and so on...

> For register as Education Organization you should pay registration fee. More information about this you can find on site.

To register, you must have a smart contract that will be used as an account for an educational organization and all management of the issuance of certificates will occur from the address of this smart contract.
We provide a basic smart contract that can be used to get started quickly. In addition, we will add the ability to quickly launch a project directly from our website.

In addition, after registration, the owner of the company will receive an Education Organization NFT at his address, which will provide him with access to the organization’s control panel on the project website.

### Education Certificates

Educational organizations may issue education certificates. Certificates of education are NFT compatible smart contracts that can be linked to the user’s profile.

All educational certificates are issued through and under contract with the organization. This allows organizations to maintain control over the certificates issued.

The issued certificates can be either general or contain notes on individual knowledge acquired.

### Education Protocol Role

The role of Education Protocol in the project is to provide convenient tools for issuing and monitoring certificates, following standards and preventing fraudulent actions on the part of organizations or users.

We provide:

- SDK for painless integration of your website or CRM
- Tools for working with students
- Tools for issuing, managing and validating certificates
- New opportunities for integration with blockchain, analytics and process automation
